During a recent Design Jam meetup, we were presented with the task of redesigning the data portal for the Texas Justice Initiative website. 

The intent was to have the data presented in a way to encourage more exploration and made user-friendly. I took on the task after the sprint was finished and came up with some visuals to accompany our work. The dashboard below highlights some suggested layout improvements that can be incorporated into the original site.

For comparison, the original site can be seen [here.](http://texasjusticeinitiative.org/data/)
