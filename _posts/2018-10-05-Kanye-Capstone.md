Kanye West has been one of the most controversial public figures over the last decade and recently has been scrutinized for his his views on politics and Trump. This has led to many viewing his actions as something to joke about or being dismiss as crazy.

However, on his latest album __ye__, he openly states on the cover _“I hate being Bi-Polar, its awesome”_ and writes about bipolar disorder being his superpower on the track _Yikes_. The reality is bipolar disorder affects 6.86 million U.S. adults annually and is a critical mental health crisis needing to be addressed. Commonly misdiagnosed or treatment being avoided due to the stigma surrounding bipolar disorder, I wanted to explore if it was possible to create tools that can help predict and assist those with bipolar disorder before the onset of the more severe episodes and help them seek primary care.

_Problem Statement_

Using Machine Learning, what can we learn about how Kanye's behavior and mental state has changed over time and can this be used to build models that can help predict bipolar episodes?
