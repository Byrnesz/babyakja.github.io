Campaigns have radically changed. As demonstrated in 2016, viral content and online message can have a powerful influence over the state of the race. Party platforms have less influence now than what is being discussed across the internet. The challenge for modern campaigns is to be able to effectively stay on top and get the message they want to reach voters.

With the midterm election fast approaching, it is essential for campaigns to know where they stand in the race. We know that there are many social media platforms out there and much of their content can be traced back to Reddit. With the speed at which viral content spreads, it is vital to know if your message is working or if your opponent's attack ads are negatively affecting your campaign.

We will take the high profile campaign between Beto O'Rourke (D) and Ted Cruz (R).

_Applied Tools:_

- webscraping
- APIs
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Conclusion**

Binary predictor can be effective in a first stage classification but can miss subtle things like sarcasm and word proximity. In the case of the subreddit posts from r/texas, posts with the highest probability as pro-Cruz were some of the strongest insults.
