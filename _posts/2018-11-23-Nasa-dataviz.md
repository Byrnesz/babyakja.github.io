Now that the holiday season is here and I had some extra time on my hands, I wanted to try to do challenge myself with a quick and interesting visualization projects.

To do so, I took ion this month's DataViz Battle put on by the subreddit /rDataisBeautiful. In this challenge, a dataset is supplied and it is up to the individual to come up with and create interesting and informative data visualizations.

This month, the dataset contained astronauts, both current and former, along with stats about them for things such as _Selection Year, time spent in space, and military or civilian background.
